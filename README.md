# Front-End Nanodegree Project 4 - Feed Reader Testing

This is the 4th submitted project in the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program. In this project we use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application that reads RSS feeds.

## Getting Started

Open the index.html file in a browser. Jasmine will appear in the lower portion of the page and will report on how many specs there are, how many have failed, and a breakdown of the test suites and individual tests.

## Running The Tests

Should any changes be made to the files simply reload the index.html page in the browser and the tests will automatically be run.

## Built With
* [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) - For testing
* [Google Hosted Libraries](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/)
* [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) - Open Source CDN

## Authors

* **Unknown Co-Worker** According to the original Read Me file, the original developer of this application (who clearly saw the value in testing as they included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite - decided to move on to start their own company.

* **Marc Resnik** (Udacity Nanodegree student) completed the projects
